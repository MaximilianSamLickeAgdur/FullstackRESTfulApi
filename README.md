# Good and bad things i did in this project:
Not so good stuff: \
Querying the whole database all the time, of course you dont want to do this, you want to make selective querys querying as little data as possible.\
This was due to the teamlead explicitly telling us to do it that way because some teammembers did not have SQL language experience, makes no sence butbut.\
I have basically zery to none package structure and alot of unnecessary dependencies and as for cybersecurity there are alot of flaws.
Good stuff: \
All the functionality should be up to par! : \
Logins, registering, purchase-function, contact us, product-filtering etcetera.\
